## Introduction
This project aims to predict the capacity of batteries using machine learning algorithms based on various input parameters such as temperature, voltage, and time. We utilize discharge cycle data from batteries B0005, B0006, B0007, and B0018 to train and evaluate our predictive models.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal is to develop accurate models for predicting the capacity of batteries over time. This has significant applications in industries reliant on battery-powered devices, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.

## Current Solutions
Existing approaches for battery capacity prediction often rely on empirical models or physics-based models. These methods may suffer from limited accuracy or scalability issues when dealing with large datasets or complex battery chemistries.

## Shortcomings
- Empirical models may lack accuracy, especially when applied to diverse battery chemistries or operating conditions.
- Physics-based models can be computationally expensive and may require detailed knowledge of battery chemistry and construction.

## Our Solution
We propose a machine learning-based approach for battery capacity prediction. By leveraging discharge cycle data and employing regression algorithms, we aim to develop accurate and scalable models for predicting battery capacity. Our solution offers flexibility and robustness across different battery chemistries and operating conditions.

## Code Explanation
We have provided Python code in the notebook `battery_capacity_prediction.ipynb`. This notebook contains the implementation of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using various regression algorithms. The code utilizes discharge cycle data from batteries B0005, B0006, B0007, and B0018 to train predictive models and evaluate their performance.
